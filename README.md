# familygazette
A beginner Django web-app with the goal to link member of families and keep update about their activities. Kind of a family social network. Option is targeted to assemble everything and print it afterwards in order to have it in a more material way.

It is a simple app, designed to learn Django Framework. To use it I advise you to have an already created project from which you will take the database (I used the default SQLite) and all the config files that are not included. Then it should work fine :-)
